.SH "NAME"
Skaffari - Web based email account managemant

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B Skaffari
is a web based interface to manage email accounts. It is currently based on the following components that play together:
.I Cyrus-IMAP
server,
.I Postfix
MTA,
.I MySQL/MariaDB
database server,
.I Cyrus-SASL
authentication daemon and
.IR "pam_mysql".
It is inpired by the PHP web-cyradm web interface and can import the settings and database from web-cyradm for an easy migration to
.BR "Skaffari".

Using administrators and domain managers,
.B Skaffari
provides a simple administrator user management where administrators can change everything and domain managers are only responsible for their domains. Where administrators can create new domains to manage, domain managers can only change a limited set of options for their domains. Creating new accounts for a domain is restricted by per domain limitations that can be set by the administrators. A domain manager can only create and edit accounts that are inside domains the manager is responsible for. At least one administrator account is needed to run
.BR "Skaffari",
domain managers can be connected to multiple domains.

Multiple domains can be managed, each with its own set of managers and accounts. Domains can be limited by administrators to not exceed a defined amount of accounts and/or disk quota. Single accounts can have individual storage quotas (needed, if there is a domain quota) as well as individual access to IMAP, POP, Sieve and SMTP (has to be also configured in
.IR "pam_mysql").
Also every account can have multiple email addresses and forwards defined.

.B Skaffari
itself is written in Qt/C++ using the
.I Cutelyst
web application framework.

.SH "SETUP"
.B skaffaricmd(8)

installation. It will create the configuration and database layout. For details about the setup processs, see
