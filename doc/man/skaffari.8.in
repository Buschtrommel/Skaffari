.SH "NAME"
Skaffari - Web based email account managemant

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B Skaffari
is a web based interface to manage email accounts. It is currently based on the following components that play together:
.I Cyrus-IMAP
server,
.I Postfix
MTA,
.I MySQL/MariaDB
database server,
.I Cyrus-SASL
authentication daemon and
.IR "pam_mysql".
It is inpired by the PHP web-cyradm web interface and can import the settings and database from web-cyradm for an easy migration to
.BR "Skaffari".

Using super administrators and domain administrators,
.B Skaffari
provides a simple admin user management where super administrators can change everything and domain administrators are only responsible for their domains. Where super administrators can create new domains to manage, domain administrators can only change a limited set of options for their domains. Creating new accounts for a domain is restricted by per domain limitations that can be set by the super administrators. A domain administrator can only create and edit accounts that are inside domains the admin is responsible for. At least one super administrator account is needed to run
.BR "Skaffari",
domain administrators can be connected to multiple domains.

Multiple domains can be managed, each with its own set of administrators and accounts. Domains can be limited by super administrators to not exceed a defined amount of accounts and/or disk quota. Single accounts can have individual storage quotas (needed, if there is a domain quota) as well as individual access to IMAP, POP, Sieve and SMTP (has to be also configured in
.IR "pam_mysql").
Also every account can have multiple email addresses and forwards defined.

.B Skaffari
itself is written in Qt/C++ using the
.I Cutelyst
web application framework.

.SH "SETUP"
.B skaffaricmd(8)

installation. It will create the configuration and database layout. For details about the setup processs, see
